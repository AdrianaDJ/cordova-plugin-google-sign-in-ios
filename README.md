# Google Sign-in for iOS Framework Plugin

This Cordova plugin adds the Google Sign-in iOS framework to a project.

It leaves out the GooglePlus.bundle directory, which is needed only when using the
Google+ sign-in button.

The SDK is available directly here: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/sdk/
